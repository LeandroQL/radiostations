Corner Case Technology Front End Task.

The app is hosted by firebase at https://radiostation-49883.firebaseapp.com/ with the backend hosted by GCloud at https://radio-station-backend.appspot.com

Builded a simple API to fetch stations, if you feel like using, go to src > components > Card and change lines 31 and 32.
If you want to see the API code feel free to contact me through my email: leandro.qlisboa@gmail.com.

I also made two other versions, one with redux and one with Class Components, both using styled-components. I'll happly send them, if requested.

I would greatly appreciate it if you kindly give me some feedback about my coding skills so I can improve.

Best Regards,
Leandro Queiroz Lisboa.
